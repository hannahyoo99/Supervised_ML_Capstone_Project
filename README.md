# Challenge 
Mo Cars is a used car dealership that buys inexpensive used cars from online marketplaces and resells them for a profit. As a member of their data team, you have been asked to help outline a data-driven approach to meeting the company's business goals.

## Objectives
1. Identify used cars for sale on Craigslist that Mo Cars can resell at a higher price by a linear regression model to predict the price that they can sell used cars for
2. Make sure to avoid Craigslist scams so that they don't lose money in the process by a logistic regression model to predict whether or not a Craigslist post is a scam
